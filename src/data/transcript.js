YouTube tutorial video in this video I'm 
going to show you how to get super 
thanks on your YouTube videos so if 
you've ever gone to a YouTube video and 
you see this little thanks icon right 
here called super thanks this is a new 
feature that YouTube is slowly rolling 
out to monetize creators that allows 
people to quickly donate money to them 
as a thanks for the content in their 
videos now this is still a very 
experimental feature on YouTube and you 
have to be one of the seemingly randomly 
selected channels on YouTube to be able 
to get it so to begin this tutorial 
we'll go through the process of looking 
to see if you're eligible and if you 
actually have the ability to enable 
super thanks on your channel and then 
I'll show you how to actually enable it 
all right so the main requirement to be 
able to have super thanks on your 
channel is going to be that you are 
monetized so you have to have more than 
1,000 subscribers and 4,000 watch hours 
in a year once you've done that and 
you're part of the YouTube Partner 
program you're ready to check and see if 
you're eligible for super thanks and the 
first thing we need to do to see if 
we're eligible is go to the YouTube 
studio and you can quickly get to the 
YouTube Studio by first going to your 
channel on YouTube then going up into 
the top right selecting your profile 
image and in the menu select YouTube 
Studio once you're on the YouTube Studio 
simply go into the left sidebar right 
here and select monetization on the 
monetization page we'll see all the 
different ways you can get monetized and 
make money on YouTube and on here we 
need to go to the top and select supers 
now if you don't already have supers 
enabled on your channel you'll need to 
go through those steps and I have not 
done that so I'll do that for you here 
simply scroll down select get started 
and then you want to read through the 
Commerce product addendum make sure that 
you understand it and that you fully 
accept it once you read through it at 
the bottom you'll need to enter some 
information and then select the bottom 
that you agree to it so go ahead and do 
that and then go down and select accept 
right here once you select it accept 
it'll reload the page and you'll see if 
you have access to Super thanks as you 
can see here unfortunately on my channel 
I do not have access to Super thanks yet 
so if you see this message here that 
means that you are not eligible for the 
super thanks program yet but if you do 
not see that up at the top right here 
next to Super chats and super stickers 
you should have a switch that allows you 
to enable super thanks and then those 
will start showing up on any eligible 
videos that meet the criteria all right 
so that's how you get super thanks on 
your YouTube videos if you have any 
questions about this leave a comment 
below I'll get back to you as soon as I 
can if you'd like to see more YouTube 
tips and tutorials check the links in

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qz2OWUBqR4" : `Hi everyone. Hope you're all doing good 
and this video as you have seen the 
thumbnail is going to be a different 
video and I'm going to share my 
rejection experience from Google and I 
have applied for data analytics 
apprenticeship 2025 March and and I'm 
going to explain how uh things went and 
what didn't work for me and and yeah I'm 
going to share my overall experience. So 
before going through this uh interview 
process, I'll just try to explain how I 
got to know this opportunity. So I I was 
very active at LinkedIn that time. I was 
uh seeing some of the posts, some of my 
collections have told that uh the Google 
data apprenticeship and the Google 
apprenticeship program was uh in open 
and if you want to apply go and just 
apply and all. So I just went to the 
Google official careers page and I'll 
just applied with my resume. So this is 
how I uh came to know about this program 
and I just applied through the official 
portal itself. So speaking about the 
interview process for me there are 
totally five rounds. Okay. So I will 
explain one by one. The first round is 
online test that is which is aptitude 
will be conducted in those uh test. So I 
will explain the time frame also. So 
this online test for me conducted on 
November 23. I have received a mail uh 
that I'm subjected for this uh role and 
uh you can attend the online test and 
all. So they have given some time frame 
that is morning 9 to evening uh sorry 
night uh 9:00 p.m. So within the this I 
can uh take the online test any any 
anytime I want. So on November, so I 
have applied on September uh 2024 and I 
got the first mail that is online test 
mail on November 23. So this is what 
happened and after uh clearing the 
online uh test the second round which is 
telephonic ground was held on uh January 
20 25. Yeah this year 2025 at the end of 
January. So to say the date correct date 
that that is January 30 I had a first 
telephonic interview 
and so I I will not uh disclose the 
questions asked in the interview because 
that that is against the company 
policies. So yeah that was a basic uh HR 
round. They were asked about some of the 
Google products and uh and yeah why why 
do you want to join in Google and all. 
So things like this were asked and after 
this I received a a mail on the same day 
saying that you have a uh interview 
preparation uh guide on next day. So 
just uh a senior HR will come and guide 
you how do you have to uh attend the 
interviews and all. So this this is a 
group meeting. So some of the fellow 
aspirants will ask them questions and 
the senior HR will answer how how you 
have to prepare and how you have to give 
the interview and all. So this is a good 
thing by Google and after completing 
that uh they will give the study 
materials like what you have to you what 
you can expect and what the interviewer 
is expecting. So they will give a study 
material but uh no questions will come 
from the study material that is an uh 
you know that is an a preparation. So 
that is a preparation kind of thing and 
you can get a glimpse from that. So they 
have gave this uh interview preparation 
guide after the second interview that is 
telephonic interview. The third 
interview was face toface interview. Uh 
this has happened for me in February 11, 
2025. 
So the thing is uh here the interviewer 
will see how you behave and have you 
have behaved in the past like uh 
behavioral questions will be asked and 
some of the uh situational questions 
will be also asked and after uh clearing 
this so I cannot also I cannot uh give 
the exact questions that they asked me 
and I I did well in the third face to 
face sorry third interview that is a 
face tof face interview and the fourth 
interview is also a face tof face 
interview and which is uh conducted on 
February 20th, 2025. And here the 
toughness of the uh questions will be 
high and some of the domain related 
domain specific questions and u you know 
uh the role related questions will be 
asked. So that is what they asked me and 
I was able to manage. I was not super 
and I was not very below average. I was 
able to manage and give the answers uh 
to them. And after that uh they 
conducted me an another round for us. 
This is the decider round for me. And uh 
in the last round which is the fifth 
round I had I know I had some time to 
prepare in in all of this interview I 
had at least 5 to 7 days to prepare. Uh 
so that is uh good thing about Google. 
So I had time to prepare for my last 
interview also that is a decider 
interview and I know how the questions 
are going to be and how I'm going to 
prepare and all I'm I I have uh well 
aware about that. So I prepared well and 
I gave the interview. So the 
uh the final interview which I gave was 
one of the best experience I have ever 
had in my life. So the the final 
interviewer was very friendly and it was 
like a communication round and the 
questions were situational and 
analytical questions but the I was it 
was like talking to my friend or talking 
to someone who is uh who is senior or 
teammate to me. So the interview was 
very casual and I gave the answers well 
and the analytical questions and 
situational scenario based analytical 
questions were asked and final round 
also are also over. uh in March 7th the 
final round has happened. So uh fifth 
round was happened on March 7th. So I 
was waiting for almost 1 month and I 
just uh uh waiting for the result and in 
Google after these five interviews then 
another interview will happen that is 
not interview but you will not kind of 
involve to it which is team matching 
round. Team matching round is purely 
based on luck. So what happened is uh in 
my case uh they have called me on April 
3rd I guess uh April 3rd or second I 
don't so what is the date today so today 
is uh April 4th so so they called me on 
April 2nd and they informed me that we 
are sorry to inform that uh we are not 
moving to you because uh everything was 
good your interview was good and your 
interview went well so we are not moving 
you because of you didn't matched in any 
team so they have told me that the 
reason is uh team matching not uh worked 
for me. I didn't pass through the team 
matching and if if suppose you are from 
Google and you know about how team 
matching works and you you can feel free 
to use my comment section to educate me 
because I'm also not aware of why didn't 
why did they rejected me and they they 
told me the reason was you didn't pass 
through the team matching and I was like 
okay okay uh so I was like that so uh 
yeah this time luck haven't worked for 
me I did very well in the interview I 
know that I was very honest I did very 
well in the But uh luck was not there 
for me and yeah that is uh what uh I 
have to take it from that. The 
experience was really good and at the 
conclusion at the end of the day uh I 
was uh you know really very sad because 
it is a very big opportunity for me and 
uh working like working in a company 
like Google is uh is very great you know 
so uh I'm laughing now but deep down I 
know I'm very sad about this but I hope 
u everything will go good u in future. 
Yeah, this is what the this is what my 
experience at Google and yeah, this is

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoWdogtZRw8": `here's a non-nonsense guide to using 
perplexity first up while many of you 
are familiar with Chach BT and Google 
Gemini you might not know where 
perplexity fits in your AI toolkit 
imagine a spectrum on one end we have 
tools like chbt and Gemini designed for 
high brain power creative tasks on the 
other end are tools like perplexity and 
Google search which excel at delivering 
accurate and realtime information and of 
course we can't forget all the way to 
the right in a league of its own we have 
the internet's un disputed single source 
of Truth Reddit put simply for tasks 
like brainstorming editing and writing 
where you don't care about factual 
accuracy Chachi and Gemini definitely 
deliver better outputs but if you need a 
relatively high level of confidence in 
your answer like deciding which 
supplements to take or troubleshooting 
software issues perplexity is the way to 
go diving right into the settings I 
really like how perplexity lets us 
exclude our data from their training 
process while still allowing us to 
access a conversation history under the 
library tab I'll talk about the pro 
features at the very end since this 
video is mainly on the free version but 
first I need to debunk a myth other 
creators are saying buying the pro 
version of perplexity does not give you 
access to other paid AI tools like chat 
gbt even if you can select their models 
here this is because even if they use 
the same underlying model chat gbt and 
perplexity apply completely different 
fine-tuning methods for example 
perplexity optimizes for accuracy speed 
and a more search oriented approach if 
you don't know what fine-tuning means 
check out my video summarizing Google's 
intro to AI course but the bottom line 
here is even if you can select the same 
models you do not get the same 
experience as the other AI tools next 
moving on to the profile tab this self- 
inroduction section works just like 
chatab BT's custom instructions as in 
the instructions you add here apply to 
all conversations within perplexity for 
example Le my instruction include 
structure your writing and respond like 
a consultant adopt a conversational tone 
use Simple language Etc and since we 
only need to add this once to benefit 
forever I highly recommend customizing 
this to fit your needs if you're feeling 
a bit lazy I'll leave a link down below 
to my custom instructions and I'll also 
leave a link to my workspace toolkit if 
you want to make a copy of my favorite 
prompts for productivity now let's 
actually start using perplexity by going 
back to the Home tab where you'll see 
the focus feature this basically lets 
you narrow down the sources you want 
perplexity to use which can drastically 
improve the quality of your output for 
example if I'm searching for realtime 
news like nvidia's most recent earnings 
call I want to search the entire web for 
queries around fish oil supplements I 
would focus on academic sources for gym 
workout recommendations I might turn to 
Social and if I wanted to learn how to 
perform a specific exercise I might want 
to watch some videos the writing option 
is perplexity attempt at offering a more 
creative oriented model and as you can 
see it generates text without searching 
the web but again in my own personal 
experience I found the paid versions of 
chat GPT and Google Gemini to be much 
better at creative writing the attach 
feature is a bit weird in that free 
users can only attach and upload PDFs 
but not images at the same time though 
we can just convert images to PDFs and 
upload those so I guess that's a 
workaround now let's go through a real 
world use case how to force Wi-Fi 
connection after connecting to Marriott 
Wi-Fi on an iPhone since I chose to 
search the entire web we can see that 
perplexity Drew from a variety of 
sources from Apple's help center to 
Merit help center to Reddit post I can 
click here to expand all sources and I 
can even choose to remove sources that 
are outdated or unreliable scrolling 
down we see the true power of perplexity 
instead of clicking to multiple links on 
Google to find the right answer we are 
literally giving given a set of 
instructions to follow uh by the way 
this actually works if you connect to a 
public network but don't see the login 
page you can literally just type in 
example.com in your browser and this 
forces the connection on the right is 
what I call supplementary information uh 
perplexity correctly identified that a 
might be easier for me to watch a video 
to troubleshoot my issue so provided a 
few videos here in other instances it 
might search for images to help with my 
query here's an example directly 
comparing perplexity to Google I search 
for a country with with the most gold 
medals in the most recent Olympics uh I 
actually didn't know the answer going to 
this by the way I didn't watch the 
Olympics except for the break dancing 
part and uh on Google if I click into 
the first link it tells me the number of 
gold medals each country has won in the 
entire history of the Olympics not from 
the most recent one which is a little 
bit awkward and even more Awkward I had 
to scroll all the way down to the fifth 
link here for me to find that oh in the 
most recent Olympics uh the US and China 
tied in the number of gold medals and 
that was a lot of clicking around and 
reading to find the information we 
wanted right when I type the same query 
into perplexity we actually get the 
correct answer right away and perplexity 
even includes a bit of trivia saying 
this is the first time in Olympic 
history that two countries finish with 
the exact same number of gold medals um 
in the summer games and Google's defense 
I think an apple to Apple comparison 
would have been to compare perplexity to 
Google's AI overview featur since those 
two are in the same category let me know 
in the comments if you want to see a 
video on that next up let's talk about 
my favorite feature and perplexity 
collections diving right into an example 
I'm actually visiting Japan later this 
year so I ask perplexity when to visit 
if I want to avoid the peak tourist 
season since I know I'll be doing more 
research over the next few weeks I can 
click the three dots up here add to 
collection and click new collection and 
then give this title trip to Japan 2 
since I already have an existing 
collection from previously and down here 
I can add an AI prompt that will apply 
to the entire collection in this case I 
tell perplexity to assume the role of a 
seasoned travel agent with over 20 years 
of experience helping tourists uncover 
hidden gems in Japan when providing 
recommendations prioritize local 
experiences that are tourist friendly 
and now whenever I start a new 
conversation or thread in this 
collection uh perplexity will remember 
to assume the role of a travel agent and 
give me answers tailored to my situation 
next you have a slightly more advanced 
use case as you can see I've instructed 
this collection to generate a structured 
outline uh for tens SL presentation 
following the scqa framework used by top 
consulting firms I'll leave a link to 
this the full prompt down below now 
whenever I create a new thread in this 
collection for example gaming trends for 
the next few years and the impact on app 
developers which is a topic related to 
my full-time job by the way uh 
perplexity delivers an outline for a 
presentation I can start building on 
immediately and although this workflow 
can also be achieved using custom gbts 
and Gemini gems I'm much more confident 
in the numbers and data here since 
almost every single one of these bullet 
points have sources attached to them and 
to wrap up you can access all your 
collections by clicking into the library 
Tab and you can also make edits to the 
entire collection by clicking the three 
dots here and clicking edit collection 
so far we focus on the positives so now 
let's dive into an example where 
perplexity doesn't perform very well 
compared to chat and Google Gemini here 
I use the same prompt and ask chat PT 
and perplexity to help me brainstorm 
thumbnail ideas for this video you're 
watching I'm not going to read the 
responses but if you pause the video you 
will see chp's ideas are much more 
creative and relevant and I ended up 
creating my thumbnail based on one of 
these ideas obviously this is just one 
example but I can constantly tell you 
that as of right now you're much better 
off using chat GPT or Google Gemini for 
highb brain intensive creative tasks and 
that's also another reason why 
perplexity is competing more with Google 
AI overviews than gemini or Chachi BT 
since AI overviews also provides answers 
with a higher degree of accuracy 
theoretically speaking moving on 
although I pay for perplexity Pro most 
users will be just fine with a free 
version as a pro user you can first set 
your um preferred text to text and text 
to image models as mentioned before it 
is worth mentioning that uh flux is a 
very popular image generation model 
right now and generating images is also 
a pro only feature in perplexity paid 
users can also use the pro search 
feature up to 600 times a day as opposed 
to just five times uh Pro Searchers 
basically takes into account more 
sources and the answers are more 
detailed than what you would get from a 
regular quick search and that basically 
sums up the number of differences 
between Pro and free there are some 
perplexity features I didn't touch on 
today today simply because I don't use 
them for example if you click the plus 
icon here uh you can create a page where 
perplexity generates an entire blog post 
for you based on your initial prompt and 
if I wanted to I could click here to 
publish the page and this might show up 
in the Discover tab which acts like a 
personalized news feed but I'm just not 
sure I want to be reading AI generated 
articles all day so finally if you head 
on over to labs. perplexity 
uh this playground acts like a Sandbox 
environment where developers can test 
out perplexities large language models 
before integrating them into their own 
applications if you found this video 
helpful I have an entire playlist where 
I break down complex AI topics for 
beginners see you on the next video in 
the 
meantime have a great one `,

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUoJ3o4m7xc": `[Music] 
Microsoft's latest study reveals 40 jobs 
that AI chatbots like Copilot could 
significantly impact, raising concerns 
about the future of work and job 
security across multiple industries. 
This inth analysis based on over 200,000 
real world interactions with AI tools 
introduces an AI applicability score 
that measures how closely AI 
capabilities align with the core tasks 
of various professions. The AI 
applicability score is a metric 
developed by Microsoft researchers to 
evaluate how frequently AI tools are 
used in specific jobs and how 
effectively they assist in completing 
work tasks. Rather than predicting 
outright job losses, the score 
highlights the degree to which AI can 
currently perform or augment the duties 
of workers. Jobs with a high AI overlap 
score are those where chatbots are 
already integrated into daily workflows, 
streamlining or automating routine 
tasks. The study identifies roles with 
the highest AI applicability, many of 
which involve information processing, 
communication, and repetitive tasks. The 
top 10 jobs with the strongest overlap 
include customer service 
representatives, writers and authors, 
interpreters and translators, sales 
representatives, services, historians, 
telephone operators, ticket agents and 
travel clerks, journalists, news 
analysts, CNC tool programmers, 
developers. These roles often involve 
tasks such as answering queries, 
generating text, translating languages, 
or managing routine communications. 
Areas where AI chatbots excel. For 
example, customer service 
representatives, a group comprising 
nearly 2.86 million workers, are 
particularly vulnerable as AI can handle 
many standard inquiries and support 
functions. Here are the 40 jobs that are 
most at the risk due to AI. Jobs less 
susceptible to AI automation. 
Conversely, the study highlights 40 jobs 
with minimal AI applicability, typically 
those requiring physical presence, 
manual labor, or complex interpersonal 
skills. Occupations such as heavy 
machinery operators, housekeepers, 
roofers, massage therapists, and 
dishwashers fall into this category. 
These roles demand hands-on work and 
situational judgment that current AI 
technologies cannot replicate 
effectively. Here are the 40 jobs that 
are least at the risk due to AI. 
While Microsoft's research does not 
claim AI will outright replace these 
jobs, it signals a significant shift in 
how work is performed. AI tools are 
increasingly integrated to assist or 
enhance productivity, which may lead to 
job restructuring or reduced demand for 
certain roles. Industries relying 
heavily on white collar 
information-based jobs are likely to see 
the most disruption as AI chat bots take 
on tasks traditionally done by humans. 
The study underscores the importance for 
workers and employers to adapt to this 
evolving landscape by developing new 
skills and embracing AI as a 
collaborative tool rather than a direct 
replacement. Microsoft's comprehensive 
study provides a clear snapshot of the 
jobs most and least vulnerable to AI 
chatbot integration in 2025. With 40 
occupations identified as highly 
susceptible to AI's current 
capabilities, workers in roles such as 
customer service, writing, translation, 
and sales should be aware of the 
potential impact on their professions. 
Meanwhile, jobs requiring physical labor 
or complex human interaction remain 
relatively safe from AI disruption for 
now. For more news and updates, keep

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rEWBIX7Rp8" :`16-year-old Adam Rain lived in 
California. He loved basketball, video 
games, and dogs. Rain's friends saw him 
as a funny teen. He cracked jokes and 
disrupted classes to get a few laughs. 
But he was also going through a rough 
patch. He was diagnosed with an 
irritable bowel syndrome. So he switched 
to an online program in school. Around 
November last year, he started using 
Chad GPT at first for school work, but 
then he started discussing plans to end 
his life. Gradually, he became 
withdrawn. In January this year, he 
signed up for a paid Chad GPT account. 
He talked about seeing no meaning in 
life. 
So, Chad GPT responded with empathy, 
trying to encourage him. Then, Rain went 
a step further. He started looking up 
suicide methods and Chad GPT supplied 
them. At some point, the bot detected 
mental distress. So it listed emergency 
helpline numbers but the teen bypassed 
these safeguards. He said he was only 
researching 
and then in April he killed himself. No 
note, no warning. His friends and family 
could not believe it. So his father 
turned to Rain's smartphone seeking 
answers. 
First he went through his son's text 
messages, then his social media apps, 
but he got no clues. Then he sifted 
through the chat GPT logs and he was 
shocked. His teenage son has been 
discussing or had been discussing ending 
his life with Chad GPT for months. 
So now Adam reigns parents have sued 
OpenAI. That's the parent company of 
Chad GPT. The parents say that the 
chatbot encouraged their son to take his 
life. This is the first legal action 
accusing OpenAI of wrongful death 
but not the first case of its kind. Last 
year, a teenager in Florida killed 
himself and his mother sued a popular 
chatbot called Character AI, blaming it 
for her son's death. The year before 
that, a Belgian man ended his life. He 
had confided in an AI chatbot before his 
death. According to his widow, the bot 
encouraged him to do so. Unfortunately, 
such cases are becoming increasingly 
common. AI is developing at lightning 
speed. Now, there are thousands of chat 
bots. They can type, talk, hear. They 
have personalities, faces, backstories, 
and millions of users. Chat GPT alone is 
used by 700 million people every week. 
700 million. AI bots are a near 8 
billion global market. But as they 
explode, their purpose is shifting. 
Initially, they were seen as a 
repository of knowledge like a new age 
Google search. You can ask them almost 
anything and within seconds, you have 
the answer. But now people are 
increasingly using AI bots to form 
emotional connections as friendly 
companions, as romantic partners, even 
as AI therapists. 
But as people get attached to artificial 
intelligence, research is playing 
catch-up about what comes next. 
Its findings are mixed. Some surveys 
show benefits with people saying that 
they no longer have suicidal thoughts 
after talking to chatbots regularly. 
But some studies disagree. 
This one was this one was conducted by 
OpenAI and MIT. It found that the higher 
the chatbot use, the more the 
loneliness. 
Other reports talk about people having 
delusional conversations with chat bots, 
episodes of AI fueled mania and 
conversations about suicide and 
violence. 
And what about safety? 
Where are the guardrails? Who is held 
accountable in a case like this? 
Yes, some safety mechanisms are built 
into the technology, but they're not 
enough. They're far from enough. Plus, 
like I said, research is scrambling to 
keep up. So, the risks and limits are 
not clear and regulation is falling 
behind. 
It's what you call the perfect storm. 
And it has led users, us humans, into a 
cruel global psychological experiment.`
